- What is the FDA doing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?
- The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials
  across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public
  health during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support
  development of  medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance,
  and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines,
  therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating,
  and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal
  food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.
- What is an emergency use authorization and how is it being used to respond to COVID-19?
- An emergency use authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability
  and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, tests, and medicines, during
  public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Under an EUA,
  the FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of
  approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious
  or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have
  been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.
  Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when
  to submit an EUA request to the FDA.
- How can I prevent COVID-19?
- 'The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccinated with an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized
  COVID-19 vaccine and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.

  In addition, the CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the
  spread of COVID-19.

- What treatments are available in the U.S. to treat COVID-19?
- "The FDA has approved and authorized treatments for COVID-19 for emergency use during\
  \ this public health emergency. View the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization\
  \ (EUA) page to see all products authorized to treat COVID-19. Read our article:\
  \ Know Your Treatment Options for COVID-19."
- Will Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) cure COVID-19?
- "No. Miracle Mineral Solution does not cure COVID-19 and has not been approved by\
  \ the FDA for any use. The solution, when mixed as directed, forms industrial bleach\
  \ that may cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. The FDA\
  \ took action against Genesis II Church of Health and Healing for unlawfully distributing\
  \ Miracle Mineral Solution for the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases. Learn\
  \ more: Danger: Don\u2019t Drink Miracle Mineral Solution or Similar Products."
- Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?
- "One of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk\
  \ of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the\
  \ CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential,\
  \ especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing,\
  \ or blowing one\u2019s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends\
  \ consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\
  To stay informed, visit the FDA\u2019s Hand Sanitizers and COVID-19 page. Also,\
  \ take our hand sanitizer quiz."
- What do I do if I get a rash or other reaction to hand sanitizer? What do I do if
  I have been exposed to contaminated hand sanitizer?
- "Call your doctor if you experience a serious reaction to hand sanitizer. People\
  \ who have been exposed to contaminated hand sanitizer and are experiencing symptoms\
  \ should seek immediate medical treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects.\n\
  The FDA encourages consumers and health care professionals to report adverse events\
  \ experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to the FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse\
  \ Event Reporting program:.\nInclude as much information as you can about the product\
  \ that caused the reaction, including the product name, the manufacturer, and the\
  \ lot number (if available).\nSee Q&A for Consumers: Hand Sanitizers and COVID-19\
  \ and Safely Using Hand Sanitizer for more information."
- What is the risk of using a hand sanitizer that contains methanol (wood alcohol)
  or 1-propanol?
- 'Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent
  blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although
  people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young
  children who accidentally swallow these products and adolescents and adults who
  drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk.

  Swallowing or drinking a hand sanitizer with 1-propanol can result in decreased
  breathing and heart rate, among other serious symptoms, and can lead to death. Hand
  sanitizer with 1-propanol contamination can irritate your skin (or eyes, if exposed).
  Although it is rare, some people have reported allergic skin reactions. Learn more
  about methanol and 1-propanol toxicities.'
- What should I do with hand sanitizer on the FDA's list of hand sanitizers that consumers
  should not use?
- "If you have one of the products on the FDA's list of hand sanitizers consumers\
  \ should not use, immediately stop using it and dispose of the product, ideally\
  \ in a hazardous waste container. Do not pour these products down the drain or flush\
  \ them. Contact your local waste management and recycling center for more information\
  \ on hazardous waste disposal. Learn how to search the FDA\u2019s hand sanitizer\
  \ list, including a description of how to search for manufacturers and distributors\
  \ on the label."
- Does spraying people with disinfectant, or having people go through disinfectant
  tunnels, walkways, or chambers, lower the spread of COVID-19?
- "No. The FDA does not recommend spraying humans with aerosolized disinfectant. At\
  \ this time, there is a lack of data to demonstrate that sanitation tunnels are\
  \ effective in reducing the spread of or in treating COVID-19.\nChemicals used in\
  \ sanitation tunnels can irritate the skin, eyes, or airways and cause other health\
  \ issues.\nHand sanitizers are only for use on the hands and are not to be used\
  \ over larger body surfaces, ingested, inhaled, or injected. Given serious safety\
  \ concerns and the lack of data to demonstrate that sanitation tunnels are effective\
  \ in reducing the spread of or in treating COVID-19, the FDA strongly discourages\
  \ the use or development of sanitation tunnels at this time, as described in this\
  \ February 2022 guidance titled \u201CCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Policy on\
  \ COVID-19-Related Sanitation Tunnels.\u201D.\nSurface disinfectants or sprays should\
  \ not be used on humans or animals. They are intended for use on hard, non-porous\
  \ surfaces (materials that do not absorb liquids easily). CDC provides information\
  \ regarding disinfectant practices for surfaces. CDC states you should never eat,\
  \ drink, breathe or inject disinfectants into your body or apply directly to your\
  \ skin as they can cause serious harm."
- Products online claim to prevent or treat COVID-19. Where can I report websites
  selling products with fraudulent claims?
- "The FDA advises consumers to be beware of websites and stores selling products\
  \ that claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. If you have a question about a\
  \ product sold online that claims to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19, talk to your\
  \ health care provider or doctor.\nRead this Consumer Update to learn how to protect\
  \ yourself and your family from coronavirus fraud.\nPlease report websites selling\
  \ products with fraudulent claims about treatment or prevention of COVID-19. If\
  \ you have experienced a bad reaction to a product sold with COVID-19 claims, report\
  \ it to the FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program:.\nInclude as much\
  \ information as you can about the product that caused the reaction, including the\
  \ product name, the manufacturer, and the lot number (if available)."
- Am I at risk for serious complications from COVID-19 if I smoke cigarettes?
- "Yes. Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases\
  \ the risk of more severe illness from COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization,\
  \ the need for intensive care, or even death. Smoking cigarettes can cause inflammation\
  \ and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making\
  \ it less able to fight off disease.\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to quit\
  \ smoking. If you need resources to help you quit smoking, the FDA has supportive\
  \ tips and tools to help you get closer to quitting for good."
- If I vape tobacco or nicotine am I at risk for complications from COVID-19?
- E-cigarette use can expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, but whether those exposures
  increase the risk of COVID-19 or the severity of COVID-19 outcomes is not known.
  However, many e-cigarette users are current or former smokers, and cigarette smoking
  increases the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia.
- What is the FDA process for a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use versus
  an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine?
- "Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) can be used by the FDA during public health\
  \ emergencies to provide access to unapproved vaccines (or unapproved uses of an\
  \ approved vaccine) that may be effective in preventing a disease. Emergency use\
  \ authorization is a tool that the FDA can use in a declared public health emergency,\
  \ like the current pandemic, to more rapidly make available potentially life-saving\
  \ products under very specific conditions. In determining whether to issue an EUA\
  \ for a vaccine, after the FDA receives a request for an EUA, the agency evaluates\
  \ the data submitted, conducts its own analyses and assesses any known or potential\
  \ risks and any known or potential benefits.\nFor the COVID-19 vaccines that the\
  \ FDA has authorized for emergency use, the agency evaluated data submitted by the\
  \ manufacturers about the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness, conducted its\
  \ own analyses of the data, and determined that the vaccine has met the statutory\
  \ criteria for issuance of an EUA. The FDA has determined that the totality of the\
  \ available data provide evidence that the vaccine may be effective in preventing\
  \ COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh\
  \ the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine\u2019s use in millions of\
  \ people.\nA vaccine that the FDA approved for use in the U.S. has undergone the\
  \ agency\u2019s standard scientific and regulatory evaluation processes. The FDA\u2019\
  s process to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine relies upon the\
  \ submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) by a company. By submitting\
  \ a BLA to the FDA, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine\
  \ for use in the United States.  The FDA\u2019s evaluation to determine the safety\
  \ and effectiveness of vaccines is among the most comprehensive in the world. This\
  \ includes the agency\u2019s independent verification of analyses submitted by the\
  \ company in the BLA, our own analyses of the data, along with a detailed assessment\
  \ of the manufacturing processes, test methods and manufacturing facilities.\nFor\
  \ the COVID-19 vaccines, a BLA builds upon the data and information that supported\
  \ the EUA, such as preclinical and clinical data, as well as details of the manufacturing\
  \ process and the sites where the vaccine is made. After its evaluation, the FDA\
  \ decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the\
  \ U.S. If the FDA approves the vaccine, the company is permitted to market it in\
  \ the U.S. for use in the population for which it is approved."
- Which COVID-19 vaccines are FDA-approved or authorized for emergency use?
- 'FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines:.

  18 years of age and older for whom other FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines
  are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and to individuals 18 years of age
  and older who elect to receive the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine because they would otherwise
  not receive a COVID-19 vaccine.'
- Which COVID-19 vaccines have the FDA authorized for administration of an additional
  primary series dose for immunocompromised individuals?
- For individuals who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed
  with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise,
  the following COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for administration of an additional
  primary series dose:.
- How does the FDA ensure the quality of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical products
  authorized for emergency use in the U.S.?
- The FDA takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure the quality of vaccines
  and other medical products for use during this pandemic. The agency is using a variety
  of inspectional tools to help ensure that products being produced in different facilities
  meet the high-quality standards that the public has come to expect. The FDA will
  continue to work with companies to ensure that the quality standards that it expects
  for products distributed under an emergency use authorization are met, and will
  continue to work diligently to help bring needed medical products in a timely manner
  to Americans during this public health emergency.
- How do I report COVID-19 vaccine side effects?
- 'If you experience a severe allergic reaction or any life-threatening symptoms such
  as trouble breathing, call 911, or go to the nearest hospital.

  Call the vaccination provider or your health care provider if you have any side
  effects that bother you or do not go away. Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC
  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967
  or report online to https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. Please include the name
  of the vaccine in the first line of box #18 of the report form.

  You may also be given an option to enroll in v-safe. V-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based
  tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been
  vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. V-safe
  asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe also
  provides second-dose reminders if needed and live telephone follow-up by CDC if
  participants report a significant health impact following COVID-19 vaccination.

- Can a COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility in women?
- "There is no scientific evidence to suggest that FDA-authorized or FDA-approved\
  \ COVID-19 vaccines could cause infertility in women. In addition, infertility is\
  \ not known to occur as a result of natural COVID-19 disease, further demonstrating\
  \ that immune responses to the virus, whether induced by infection or a vaccine,\
  \ are not a cause of infertility. Reports on social media have falsely asserted\
  \ that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause infertility in women and the FDA is concerned\
  \ that this misinformation may cause women to avoid vaccination to prevent COVID-19,\
  \ which is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease. The symptoms of COVID-19\
  \ vary and are unpredictable; many people have no symptoms or only mild disease,\
  \ while some have severe respiratory disease including pneumonia and acute respiratory\
  \ distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death.\nSARS-CoV-2\
  \ is the virus that causes COVID-19. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Comirnaty, Moderna,\
  \ Pfizer-BioNTech, and Spikevax) contain a piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019s\
  \ genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the virus\u2019s distinctive\
  \ \u201Cspike\u201D protein. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine uses a type of adenovirus\
  \ that cannot replicate to deliver a piece of the DNA, or genetic material, that\
  \ is used to make the distinctive \u201Cspike\u201D protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\
  After a person is vaccinated, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which\
  \ does not cause disease, and triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively,\
  \ producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to false reports on\
  \ social media, this protein is not the same as any involved in formation of the\
  \ placenta."
- Can the FDA help me get a COVID-19 vaccine?
- "No. The FDA\u2019s authority includes authorizing or approving COVID-19 vaccines\
  \ for use in the U.S., but the FDA is not responsible for vaccine distribution.\
  \ Search vaccines.gov, text your zip code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find\
  \ COVID-19 vaccine locations near you.\nGo to the CDC website to find your state\
  \ and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\
  \ All questions and concerns related to vaccine distribution should be sent to your\
  \ state government or local health department.\nIf you are contacted directly by\
  \ someone who says they are from the FDA about a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, it\
  \ is a scam. The Federal Trade Commission has easy tips on how to avoid COVID-19\
  \ vaccine scams. The FDA encourages you to report a potential COVID-19 drug or medical\
  \ product scam on our website."
- Do any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use or approved by the
  FDA contain a live form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19
  disease)?
- "None of the currently FDA-authorized or approved vaccines contain the live SARS-CoV-2\
  \ virus, and you can\u2019t get COVID-19 from the vaccines."
- Are egg products used in COVID-19 vaccines?
- "No. The COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized or approved by the FDA are not manufactured\
  \ using egg products or egg culture.\u202FSee COVID-19 vaccines for more information."
- Can SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, be transmitted by blood transfusion?
- In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion,
  and there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus worldwide.
- What steps are being taken to protect the U.S. blood supply from SARS-CoV-2, the
  virus that causes COVID-19?
- 'Blood donors must be healthy and feel well on the day of donation. Routine blood
  donor screening measures that are already in place should prevent individuals with
  clinical respiratory infections from donating blood. For example, blood donors must
  be in good health and have a normal temperature on the day of donation.

  Donors are instructed to contact the donor center if they become ill after donation,
  so that their blood or plasma will not be used. Even when a donor develops COVID-19
  after donation, however, there have been no cases of COVID-19 linked to donor blood
  or products made from blood.

  The FDA has provided additional information to blood establishments on its website.'
- "Why aren\u2019t blood centers testing donors for SARS-CoV-2?"
- The FDA does not recommend using laboratory tests to screen blood. Someone who has
  symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, is not healthy
  enough to donate blood. Standard screening processes already in place will mean
  that someone with these symptoms will not be allowed to donate.
- Is it safe for me to donate blood during the COVID-19 pandemic?
- It is imperative that eligible individuals continue to donate blood and blood components,
  including source plasma, during the pandemic. If you are healthy and interested
  in donating blood, the FDA encourages you to contact a local donation center to
  make an appointment. One way to make a difference during a public health emergency
  is to donate blood if you are able.
- Can I donate blood following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine?
- Yes, individuals who receive a nonreplicating, inactivated or mRNA-based COVID-19
  vaccine can donate blood without a waiting period.
- What is convalescent plasma and why is it being investigated to treat COVID-19?
- Convalescent refers to anyone recovering from a disease. Plasma is the yellow, liquid
  part of blood that contains antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body
  in response to infections.  Convalescent plasma from patients who have already recovered
  from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contain antibodies against COVID-19.
  The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma for the
  treatment of COVID-19 in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. The FDA has
  issued guidance to provide recommendations to health care providers and investigators
  on the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma during the public health emergency. The
  guidance also provides recommendations to blood establishments on collection of
  COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
- What does it mean to be an FDA-approved drug?
- "FDA approval of a drug means that the agency has determined, based on substantial\
  \ evidence, that the drug is effective for its intended use, and that the benefits\
  \ of the drug outweigh its risks when used according to the product\u2019s approved\
  \ labeling. The drug approval process takes place within a structured framework\
  \ that includes collecting clinical data and submitting an application to the FDA.\
  \ Learn more about the FDA\u2019s drug review process."
- "What is the FDA\u2019s role in regulating potential treatments during a public\
  \ health emergency?"
- 'The FDA carries out many activities to protect and promote public health during
  a public health emergency, including helping to accelerate the development and availability
  of potential treatments, protecting the security of drug supply chains, providing
  guidance to food and medical device manufacturers, advising developers on clinical
  trial issues, and keeping the public informed with authoritative health information.

  The FDA is committed to supporting the development of new drugs, and the potential
  repurposing of existing drugs, to address COVID-19 by working with potential drug
  makers and sponsors to rapidly move products into clinical trials, helping to ensure
  that trials are properly designed and safe, and protecting the public from potentially
  unsafe products.

- What drugs (medicines) are available in the U.S. to treat COVID-19?
- "The FDA has approved and authorized treatments for COVID-19 for emergency use during\
  \ this public health emergency. View the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization\
  \ (EUA) page to see all products authorized to treat COVID-19. Products that have\
  \ been approved to treat COVID-19 without any remaining EUA authorized uses can\
  \ be found on the FDA\u2019s COVID-19 Drugs page. Read our article: Know Your Treatment\
  \ Options for COVID-19."
- What is a monoclonal antibody?
- Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies
  that can restore, enhance or mimic the immune system's attack on cells. Monoclonal
  antibodies for COVID-19 may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching
  to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce and cause harm.
  Monoclonal antibodies may also neutralize a virus.
- Where are infusions of monoclonal antibody treatments available?
- 'The following websites contain information regarding access to monoclonal antibody
  treatments for COVID-19:.

  Monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 may only be administered in settings
  in which health care providers have immediate access to medications to treat a severe
  infusion reaction, such as anaphylaxis, and have the ability to activate the emergency
  medical system (EMS), if necessary. Please speak with your doctor or contact your
  local or state public health department for more information.'
- Are chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate approved by the FDA to treat
  COVID-19?
- "No. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and some versions of chloroquine phosphate are FDA-approved\
  \ to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also FDA-approved to treat lupus\
  \ and rheumatoid arthritis.\nOn March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use\
  \ authorization (EUA) for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to\
  \ treat adults and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial\
  \ was not available or participation was not feasible. Based on the FDA\u2019s continued\
  \ review of the scientific evidence available, the criteria for an EUA for chloroquine\
  \ phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as outlined in Section 564(c)(2) of the\
  \ FD&C Act are no longer met. As a result, the EUA for these two drugs was revoked\
  \ on June 15, 2020. Read more about this action."
- Should I take chloroquine phosphate used to treat disease in aquarium fish to prevent
  or treat COVID-19?
- "No. Products marketed for veterinary use, \u201Cfor research only,\u201D or otherwise\
  \ not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness\
  \ and should never be used by humans. The FDA is aware that chloroquine phosphate\
  \ is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been\
  \ evaluated by the FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured,\
  \ and adequately labeled. The agency continues to work with online marketplaces\
  \ to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts. Patients\
  \ should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed\
  \ health care provider. Chloroquine products also should not be given to pets or\
  \ livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian."
- Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
- No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections.
  Antibiotics do not prevent or treat COVID-19, because COVID-19 is caused by a virus,
  not bacteria. Some patients with COVID-19 may also develop a bacterial infection,
  such as pneumonia. In that case, a health care professional may treat the bacterial
  infection with an antibiotic.
- Should I take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19?
- 'No. While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not
  approved or authorized for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Read more about
  why you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19.

- What is the FDA doing to protect people from products being distributed with fraudulent
  COVID-19 claims?
- "We have established a cross-agency team dedicated to closely monitoring for fraudulent\
  \ COVID-19 products. In response to internet scammers, the FDA has taken \u2013\
  \ and continues to take \u2013 actions regarding unapproved products that are distributed\
  \ with fraudulent claims to prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. The FDA and\
  \ the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issue warning letters to companies and individuals\
  \ that are unlawfully selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims.\
  \ The FDA also has taken enforcement action against certain sellers that continued\
  \ to illegally distribute products for prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\nAdditionally,\
  \ the FDA also has reached out to major retailers to alert them about monitoring\
  \ their online marketplaces for fraudulent COVID-19 products. You can report websites\
  \ suspected of unlawfully selling medical products to the FDA through our website,\

- What at-home over-the-counter (OTC) tests for COVID-19 are authorized by the FDA?
- Search the list of FDA-authorized at-home over-the-counter (OTC) COVID-19 diagnostic
  tests.
- Do COVID-19 tests check for delta, omicron, or other variants?
- The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has mutated over time, resulting in
  genetic variants over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 diagnostic tests
  are designed to detect all known variants. However, they are typically not able
  to identify the specific type of SARS-CoV-2 variant (such as, delta or omicron)
  present in a patient sample. The FDA continues to conduct analyses to identify tests
  for which performance may be impacted for known SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally,
  the FDA has authorized genotyping tests that can specifically identify and differentiate
  SARS-CoV-2 variants or lineages. Learn more about SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations and
  COVID-19 tests.

  and surgical N95 respirators?
- "Yes, please refer to the FDA\u2019s current device shortage list. This list reflects\
  \ the categories of devices the FDA has determined to be in shortage at this time\
  \ and will be maintained and updated as the COVID-19 public health emergency evolves.\
  \ The presence of a device type on this list does not necessarily indicate that\
  \ patient care has been or will be affected.\nConcerning respirators, while there\
  \ is an increase in domestic supply of respirators for health care personnel, the\
  \ FDA continues to monitor supply and demand to assess respirator availability as\
  \ facilities systematically transition away from crisis and contingency capacity\
  \ strategies and move towards conventional use.\nThe FDA encourages manufacturers\
  \ and health care facilities to contact the FDA about a medical device supply chain\
  \ issue. For more information, see our page Medical Device Supply Chain Notifications\
  \ During the COVID-19 Pandemic."
- Can 3D printing be used to make PPE?
- Find FDA's guidance about 3D printing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- How is the FDA helping ensure that ventilators are available for patients who need
  them?
- 'The FDA continues to work with manufacturers and sponsors of ventilators and other
  respiratory support devices and accessories to help make these devices available
  through the emergency use authorization (EUA) process.

  See more information about ventilators and ventilator accessories EUAs.'
- Who should I contact if I have questions about medical devices or need more information?
- 'Please see Contacts for Medical Devices During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

  If you need information about the development of a test for SARS-CoV-2, please see
  our FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2.'
- "What is the FDA\u2019s role in helping to ensure the safety of the human and animal\
  \ food supply?"
- To protect public health, the FDA monitors domestic firms and the foods that they
  produce. The FDA also monitors imported products and foreign firms exporting to
  the U.S. The FDA protects consumers from unsafe foods through research and methods
  development; inspection and sampling; and regulatory and legal action.
- Why is the FDA providing flexibility to food manufacturers, under limited circumstances
  during the COVID-19 public health emergency, to make minor changes in ingredients
  without reflecting those changes on the package label?
- 'Due to limited shortages of specific ingredients and foods, or unexpected supply
  chain disruptions in some industries, food manufacturers may need to make small
  changes to some ingredients during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Manufacturers
  may not be able to relabel their products to reflect these minor changes on the
  food label without slowing down the processing or distribution of the food.

  To avoid slowing down food processing or distribution during the coronavirus pandemic,
  the FDA issued a guidance titled "Temporary Policy Regarding Certain Food Labeling
  Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Minor Formulation Changes
  and Vending Machines."  The temporary policy provides food manufacturers with flexibility
  to make minor formulation changes in certain, limited circumstances without making
  conforming label changes on packages as long as any substitutions or omissions of
  ingredients do not pose a health or safety issue (such as allergens), and do not
  cause significant changes in the finished product.'
- What do I need to know about the temporary policy for food labeling of minor ingredient
  changes during the COVID-19 public health emergency if I have food allergies?
- "Although the temporary policy allows some flexibility, the eight major food allergens\
  \ under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 2004\
  \ cannot be substituted for labeled ingredients by manufacturers without a corresponding\
  \ label change. While the temporary policy does not list all ingredients known to\
  \ cause sensitivities in some people, manufacturers should avoid substituting ingredients\
  \ with major food allergens or with ingredients recognized as priority allergens\
  \ (such as sesame, celery, lupin, buckwheat, molluscan shellfish, and mustard) in\
  \ other parts of the world without a label change. These flexibilities are intended\
  \ to remain in effect only for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency\
  \ in the United States. However, when this public health emergency is over, extensions\
  \ may be needed if the food and agriculture sectors need additional time to bring\
  \ supply chains back into regular order. For more information please see more Questions\
  \ and Answers on FDA\u2019s Temporary Policy on Food Labeling Changes During the\
  \ COVID-19 Pandemic."
- What are the most important things I need to know to keep myself and others safe
  when I go to the grocery store during the pandemic?
- There are steps you can take to help protect yourself, grocery store workers and
  other shoppers, such as wearing a face covering, practicing social distancing, and
  using wipes on the handles of the shopping cart or basket. Read more tips in Shopping
  for Food During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Information for Consumers.
- Are food products produced in the U.S. or other countries affected by COVID-19 a
  risk for the spread of COVID-19?
- There is no evidence to suggest that food produced in the United States or imported
  from countries affected by COVID-19 can transmit COVID-19.
- Can I get the coronavirus from food, food packaging, or food containers and preparation
  area?
- "Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being\
  \ associated with transmission of COVID-19.  Like other viruses, it is possible\
  \ that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects.\nIf you\
  \ are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after\
  \ handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare\
  \ food for eating and before you eat. Consumers can follow CDC guidelines on frequent\
  \ hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and frequently clean\
  \ and disinfect surfaces.\nIt is always important to follow the four key steps of\
  \ food safety\u2014clean, separate, cook, and chill."
- Is the U.S. food supply safe?
- "Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with\
  \ transmission of COVID-19.\nUnlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like\
  \ norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food,\
  \ SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness\
  \ and not gastrointestinal illness, and foodborne exposure to this virus is not\
  \ known to be a route of transmission.\nIt may be possible that a person can get\
  \ COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching\
  \ their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the\
  \ main way the virus spreads. It\u2019s always important to follow the four key\
  \ steps of food safety\u2014clean, separate, cook, and chill."
- Can I get COVID-19 from a food worker handling my food?
- 'Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with
  transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads from person-to-person.
  The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer
  pose a risk of infecting others.

  Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling
  procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.'
- Should food facilities (grocery stores, manufacturing facilities, restaurants, etc.)
  perform any special cleaning or sanitation procedures for COVID-19?
- "CDC recommends routine cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace,\
  \ such as workstations, countertops, and doorknobs. Use the cleaning agents that\
  \ are usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label. CDC does\
  \ not recommend any additional disinfection beyond routine cleaning at this time.\n\
  View the current list of products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against\
  \ SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19.\nRestaurants and retail food establishments\
  \ are regulated at the state and local level. State, local, and tribal regulators\
  \ use the Food Code published by the FDA to develop or update their own food safety\
  \ rules. Generally, FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to maintain clean\
  \ facilities, including, as appropriate, clean and sanitized food contact surfaces,\
  \ and to have food safety plans in place.   Food safety plans include a hazards\
  \ analysis and risk-based preventive controls and include procedures for maintaining\
  \ clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. See: FSMA Final Rule\
  \ for Preventive Controls for Human Food."
- What is the FDA doing to respond to foodborne illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic?
- "The virus that causes COVID-19 is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Viruses\
  \ like norovirus and hepatitis A that can make people sick through contaminated\
  \ food usually cause gastrointestinal or stomach illness. Currently there is no\
  \ evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission\
  \ of COVID-19.\nThe CDC, FDA, and USDA continue to work with state and local partners\
  \ to investigate foodborne illness and outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The\
  \ FDA\u2019s Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation (CORE) Network manages\
  \ outbreak response, as well as surveillance and post-response activities related\
  \ to incidents involving multiple illnesses linked to FDA-regulated human food products.\
  \ During this coronavirus outbreak, CORE\u2019s full-time staff will continue to\
  \ operate to prepare for, coordinate and carry out response activities to incidents\
  \ of foodborne illnesses.\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine manages\
  \ outbreak response for animal food and is similarly staffed and prepared to respond\
  \ to incidents of foodborne illness in animals."
- Can people get COVID-19 from pets or other animals?
- Based on the information available to date, the risk of pets or other animals spreading
  COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
- Can pets or other animals get COVID-19 from people?
- "The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals including pets,\
  \ zoo animals and wildlife and may spread to other animals, especially during close\
  \ contact. If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from\
  \ everyone else, including pets and other animals.\nIf you are sick with COVID-19\
  \ (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should avoid contact with your\
  \ pets and other animals, just like you would with people. Contact includes petting,\
  \ snuggling, kissing, licking, sharing food, and sleeping in the same bed.\nWe know\
  \ that most pets that get infected do so after close contact with their owner or\
  \ other household member with COVID-19. Consult CDC\u2019s website for the latest\
  \ recommendations about how to protect pets from the virus.\nTalk to your veterinarian\
  \ if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pet\u2019s health."
- Should I get my pet tested for COVID-19?
- 'Routine testing of pets for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time. There is
  currently no evidence that pets are a source of COVID-19 infection people in the
  U.S. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of pets spreading
  the virus to people is considered to be low. If your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian.

  Animal testing is reserved for situations when the results may affect the treatment
  or management of people and animals. If your veterinarian thinks your pet is a candidate
  for testing, they will consult the state veterinarian and public health officials.
  Do not contact your state veterinarians directly: they do not have the client/patient-veterinarian
  relationship that would allow them to fully understand the situation and they are
  also actively involved in other animal disease-related emergencies as well as response
  to COVID-19.'
- What animal species can get COVID-19?
- 'USDA''s National Veterinary Services Laboratories maintains an overview and list
  of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 on its website: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Animals
  in the United States.

  More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected
  by COVID-19. CDC updates its site with research and findings from experimental studies:
  Animals and COVID-19.'
- Can pets carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?
- "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there\
  \ is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread\
  \ to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.\nHowever, because animals can sometimes\
  \ carry other germs that can make people sick, it\u2019s always a good idea to practice\
  \ healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and\
  \ after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste.\nDo\
  \ not put masks on pets. A mask can cause harm to a pet. Do not wipe or bathe your\
  \ pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products,\
  \ such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface\
  \ cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning\
  \ your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their\
  \ skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately. If your pet ingests\
  \ hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness\
  \ after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately."
- Are there any approved products that can prevent or treat COVID-19 in animals?
- "No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, \u201Carticles intended\
  \ for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\
  \ in man or other animals\u201D are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for\
  \ the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals.\
  \ The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection\
  \ Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulates veterinary biologics,\
  \ including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin.\n\
  The FDA has taken action against unapproved products claiming to prevent or cure\
  \ COVID-19. The public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any\
  \ products claiming to do so to FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov or\
  \ 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)."
- Are there shortages or disruptions to the U.S. pet food supply?
- "In general, pet food is available. There may be intermittent decreased availability\
  \ of certain brands/flavors, but there has been and continues to be product available\
  \ to meet pets\u2019 nutritional needs.\nIf a specific preferred flavor or brand\
  \ is temporarily unavailable, pet owners may need to opt for a short-term alternative.\n\
  There have been some reports of decreased availability of some specially formulated\
  \ veterinary diets that are used to both provide nutrition and address a diagnosed\
  \ medical condition, which may make it more difficult to find an alternative diet.\
  \ If a pet needs a specialty diet, it may be helpful for pet owners to consult a\
  \ veterinarian to find a recommended alternative diet."
- Are there any animal drug shortages due to the COVID-19 outbreak?
- 'The FDA has been and is continuing to closely monitor how the COVID-19 outbreak
  may impact the animal medical product supply chain.

  While the FDA does not have regulatory authority requiring the animal drug industry
  to report shortages, we have been reaching out to manufacturers as part of our approach
  to identifying potential disruptions or shortages. We will use all available tools
  to react swiftly to help mitigate the impact if a potential disruption or shortage
  is identified.
