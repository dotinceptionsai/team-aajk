- What is a species adoption and what do I get?
- "Our adoptions are symbolic for donating and supporting our conservation work with\
  \ a particular species. We chose the word \u2018adoption\u2019 because it implies\
  \ responsibility and care for the future of an endangered species, as opposed to\
  \ 'animal sponsorship' which could suggest a more disconnected and distanced approach.\
  \ The animals we follow as part of the adoption will always remain in the wild.\
  \ By adopting an animal, you will be supporting a whole group of these animals,\
  \ rather than one individual.\nDonations from our adoptions go both directly to\
  \ support the species adopted, as well as to fund our wider work to protect nature\
  \ and our planet.\nIncluded in our standard species adoptions is an optional plush\
  \ toy of your chosen species and field notes on the animal which includes a keepsake\
  \ photograph, fantastic facts about the species, information about our conservation\
  \ work, a certificate and a postcard.\nOur Under 12\u2019s species adoptions include\
  \ a colouring-in activity \u2018wrap\u2019, an optional plush toy of your chosen\
  \ animal, a certificate, an interactive booklet about your chosen species, a postcard\
  \ and information about what we do.\nWe will send you three updates a year in February,\
  \ June and October about your chosen species and how your incredible support is\
  \ helping."
- How do I set up an adoption?
- "Thank you so much for your support! You can set up an adoption easily online here\
  \ \u2013 please see further information on our payment options below. Alternatively,\
  \ you\u2019re welcome to call our friendly adoption team on 0800 035 5929 (open\
  \ 7 days a week - 8am to 10pm) and they\u2019d be happy to help you set it up over\
  \ the phone.\nYou can choose to set up an adoption for yourself, or as a gift for\
  \ someone else. If you\u2019re setting it up as a gift and would like the initial\
  \ welcome pack to be sent to you so that you can gift it on, make sure to select\
  \ the \u2018send welcome pack to my address\u2019 option during the checkout process.\
  \ The future updates will automatically go to your recipient's address unless you\
  \ let us know otherwise."
- How long will my adoption last for?
- "If you're donating by Direct Debit, your adoption will continue every month until\
  \ you contact us or your bank and ask for it to be cancelled.\nIf you're donating\
  \ by a one-off donation by credit/debit card or cheque, your adoption will last\
  \ for a year. With your final adoption update, you\u2019ll be invited to renew your\
  \ adoption."
- What are my payment options?
- "Direct Debit.\nIf you have a UK bank account, a Direct Debit is a great way to\
  \ support us; regular gifts by Direct Debit mean charities have a consistent, predictable\
  \ income, so we can plan and budget better across our conservation projects.\nPlease\
  \ note, a Direct Debit is an ongoing payment. You can cancel at any time either\
  \ through your bank or by letting us know through the details on our Contact Us\
  \ Page.\nPlease note we are unable to accept Direct Debits from a non-UK bank account\
  \ \u2013 please see our one-off payment option below.\nOne-off Donation.\nYou can\
  \ set up an adoption with a one-off donation which will ensure the adoption runs\
  \ for one year. When your adoption is due to come to an end, we\u2019ll let you\
  \ know and ask if you\u2019d like to renew it.\nThe minimum for our species adoptions\
  \ starts at a Direct Debit of \xA33.00 per month or as a one-off donation of \xA3\
  36.00 -  you can set an adoption up easily online here, or by giving our friendly\
  \ adoption team a call on 0800 035 5929 (7 days a week - 8am to 10pm)."
- How long will my welcome pack take to arrive?
- "For deliveries within the UK, your adoption pack should arrive within 2-3 working\
  \ days, though please allow up to 5 due to ongoing Royal Mail delays. If you've\
  \ chosen faster delivery, your pack should arrive within 2 working days if ordered\
  \ before 12pm. If you live on an island or in the Highlands, your pack may take\
  \ 1-2 days longer to arrive.\nFor deliveries to Europe, please allow 21 working\
  \ days.\nFor international deliveries outside of Europe, please allow 4-6 weeks.\n\
  From 1st January 2021, due to several new conditions applied to items sent from\
  \ the UK to the EU and worldwide, a mandatory phone number is now required for all\
  \ orders that will be delivered outside of the UK.\nPlease note, deliveries outside\
  \ of the UK may be susceptible to customs duty charges which are outside of WWF\u2019\
  s control. We ask that you make allowances for any charges that may be incurred\
  \ as WWF cannot be held responsible. We cannot provide tracking for deliveries outside\
  \ of the UK.\nIf you haven\u2019t received your adoption pack within the suggested\
  \ timeframe, please contact us through the details on our Contact Us Page and our\
  \ Supporter Care team will be happy to help."
- What species can I adopt?
- "We have twelve endangered species available to adopt. These include Panda, Elephant,\
  \ Rhino, Tiger, Snow Leopard, Amur Leopard, Jaguar, Orangutan, Gorilla, Penguin,\
  \ Polar Bear and Turtle.\nFurther information about these species can be found here.\n\
  There are so many species and habitats around the world that need help and we to\
  \ take a comprehensive approach in supporting both the species and the habitat they\
  \ live in, which aids all animals in that location. For example, by supporting a\
  \ Sea Turtle, you\u2019ll be helping us protect other marine wildlife and their\
  \ surrounding habitats, such as the coral reefs that they inhabit and need to survive.\n\
  When agreeing on which should be the priority species we work on, we must consider\
  \ ecological, economic and cultural importance, feasibility of success in aiding\
  \ them, and where other organisations work so we can cooperate with them."
- How is my adoption money spent?
- "Our planet\u2019s wildlife is rapidly disappearing and money from adoptions helps\
  \ us protect some of our most important species from direct threats such as hunting\
  \ or poaching, as well as indirect ones like habitat loss and climate change. 50%\
  \ of your donation will directly support the species adopted, and the remaining\
  \ 50% will help fund our wider work to protect nature and our planet, allowing us\
  \ to continue on our mission to create a world where people and nature thrive, together."
- How can I renew my adoption?
- "It\u2019s fantastic to hear that you\u2019d like to renew your adoption! Thank\
  \ you. You can renew your adoption easily online here or by contacting us with the\
  \ details on our Contact Us Page. If you've received a form through the post with\
  \ your latest update, you can complete this and return it to the address provided\
  \ and we\u2019ll do the rest."
- How do I update my personal details, bank details or contact preferences with you?
- "Thanks for keeping us up to date! Please see our Contact Us Page and if you scroll\
  \ down a bit, you\u2019ll see a list of our web forms. If you fill out the one that\u2019\
  s most in line with your query, we\u2019ll get it all sorted and get back to you\
  \ as soon as we can to confirm.\nAlternatively, you\u2019re welcome to give our\
  \ team a call on 01483 426333 (Monday to Thursday - 8am to 7pm | Fridays - 8am to\
  \ 5pm | Saturdays - 10am to 4pm).\nPlease bear in mind that, due to Data Protection\
  \ reasons, we may need the direct permission of the payer to make certain changes.\
  \ If you\u2019re unsure, just give us a call and we\u2019ll advise you."
- "Can I change the delivery address for my adoption pack after I\u2019ve placed my\
  \ order?"
- "You can update the delivery address if you inform us within 12 hours of placing\
  \ your order as long as we haven't posted it yet by calling our Supporter Care team\
  \ on 01483 426333 (8am - 7pm on Monday to Thursdays, 8am - 5pm on Fridays and 10am\
  \ - 4pm on Saturdays) and provide us with the change of address details.\nAfter\
  \ this time, I\u2019m afraid the adoption or membership pack will already be ready\
  \ for dispatch and the delivery address cannot be changed so please make sure all\
  \ the details are correct before you complete your order."
- "I haven\u2019t received my adoption welcome pack. What should I do?"
- If you haven't received your welcome pack within the given delivery time frame,
  please contact us using the details on our Contact Us Page and our Supporter Care
  team will be happy to help.
- My pack doesn't contain a certificate
- "Your adoption certificate will be the first leaflet at the front of your adoption\
  \ pack and you can also download an online certificate here if you would prefer.\
  \ If your pack doesn\u2019t contain a certificate, please contact us on the details\
  \ on our Contact Us Page and we'll be happy to send you a replacement."
- "My adoption is a gift but won\u2019t arrive on time. What can I do?"
- "If the welcome pack won't arrive in time for a special event such as a birthday,\
  \ you can print or email a personalised gift certificate online to give while you\u2019\
  re waiting for the pack to arrive here."
- What is your refund policy?
- "One-off Donation.\nUnder charity law, WWF-UK is not permitted to refund donations\
  \ but understands there may be instances where it is necessary. For example, if\
  \ a duplicate adoption has been set up in error or a credit/debit card has been\
  \ used fraudulently.\nAs part of our Supporter Promise, we engage with supporters\
  \ with empathy and understanding, developing lasting, loyal and trusted relationships.\
  \ So, if you do need to discuss your donation, please contact us using the details\
  \ on our Contact Us Page and our friendly Supporter Care team will be happy to have\
  \ a chat, see what\u2019s happened and do our best to resolve it for you.\nDirect\
  \ Debit.\nUnder the Direct Debit guarantee, you are entitled to a full refund of\
  \ the amount paid from your bank if an error is made with your Direct Debit. You\
  \ can make a Direct Debit Indemnity Claim directly with your bank who will immediately\
  \ refund the amount directly back into your account. If you think an error has been\
  \ made, please contact us on the details on our Contact Us Page and our friendly\
  \ Supporter Care team will be happy to help you resolve this."
- Why have you introduced under 12 adoption updates?
- "In 2020, we introduced under 12 welcome packs for adoptions \u2013 they've been\
  \ a big success. This showed us that we have a large audience aged 12 and under.\
  \ Because of this, it felt right to introduce adoption updates that were catered\
  \ to this age range too, with interactive and educational content that kids will\
  \ enjoy. We want to ensure that all of our products are the best that they can be\
  \ and that our supporters enjoy them."
- Can I change the adoption updates I receive?
- "You can choose whether you\u2019d like to receive standard adoption updates, or\
  \ under 12 adoption updates. To change the updates, you would like to receive, you\
  \ can do this through http://wwf.org.uk/switchupdate or you can contact us using\
  \ the details on our Contact Us Page and our Supporter Care team will be happy to\
  \ help."
- Why have you stopped the Lion & Dolphin adoptions?
- "We\u2019ve had to take a hard look at all our adoption products and both the lion\
  \ and dolphin adoptions have become less cost-effective than we\u2019d like \u2013\
  \ that means there\u2019s less funding to put towards our work protecting them.\
  \ We want to make sure we are making the best use of your donations so we have made\
  \ the decision to stop recruiting new dolphin or lion adopters and will phase out\
  \ the product by the end of October 2022. We will continue to help protect these\
  \ animals through different, more cost-efficient, methods."
- Are Lions & Dolphins not endangered anymore?
- Lions, dolphins and their habitats, still need protecting. We will continue to fund
  and support many projects of work with the aim of conserving both lions and dolphins,
  as well as the landscapes they live in. We will just no longer be offering these
  iconic species as a choice of species to adopt.
- Are you still supporting Lions & Dolphins?
- We are still working to protect all wildlife; we fund many programs across the world.
  Many of those we have in place for Lions/Dolphins will still be carrying forward
  to the best of our ability, they will just be funded in a different manner.
- What is a WWF-UK membership and what do I get?
- "There has never been a more compelling time to support WWF\u2019s work to save\
  \ our planet and Membership provides a key opportunity to achieve this. As a member\
  \ of WWF, you can continue to show your support for safeguarding our planet for\
  \ future generations. The generous donations of our members drive our vital work\
  \ as the leading independent conservation organisation and, thanks to their support\

  \ tackle climate change and address the unsustainable consumption of precious natural\
  \ resources.\nA membership is a great option for those who have an overall interest\
  \ in supporting our wider conservation work, rather than a species-specific programme.\

- How is my membership money spent?
- 70% of our income goes towards on-the-ground conservation programmes and related
  work to tackle the biggest environmental threats to our world. Of the remainder,

  we remain accountable; this includes administration costs and gifts in kind (e.g.

- How do gifts in Wills help WWF?
- "We rely on individual supporters for around 80% of our funding and we\u2019re so\
  \ grateful to the hundreds of people whose kind gifts in Wills contribute about\
  \ 20% of our income every year.\nWe prioritise tackling critical environmental challenges\
  \ and finding ways to ensure people can live in harmony with nature. WWF\u2019s\
  \ Living Planet Report shows the devastating impacts humans are having on the world\u2019\
  s wildlife and natural world. But while the challenges we face are tough, we have\
  \ the know-how to meet them. Together, with your support and our combined passion\
  \ and determination, we can build a world with a better future."
- How do I leave a gift in my Will to WWF?
- 'We always recommend having your Will written by   a solicitor with expertise in
  Wills and Probate. This is the best way to ensure that your Will accurately reflects
  your wishes and is correctly witnessed.

  WWF is a member of the National Free Wills Network   which is a scheme whereby charity
  supporters can have their simple Will written free of charge by a local participating
  solicitor. Although gifts in Wills are a vital source of funding for our conservation
  work, there is no obligation to remember WWF or any charity. If you are a WWF supporter
  and would like to find out more information about the Network offer, please contact
  Ella at ella@wwf.org.uk or call 01483 412153.'
- What are your registered details?
- 'Our registered Charity number is: 1081247.

  Our registered address is:.

  WWF-UK

  The Living Planet Centre

  Rufford House

  Brewery Road

  Woking

  Surrey

  GU21 4LL.'
- What type of gift can I leave?
- "The most common gifts we receive are for a specific cash amount (pecuniary gift)\
  \ or a percentage share of an estate (residuary gift) and you can see suggested\
  \ wording for these types of gifts below.\nWe also benefit from other gifts, like\
  \ specific items (e.g. paintings, jewellery etc) or gifts in trust. Your solicitor\
  \ will be able to advise you on which type of gift is most appropriate to your wishes\
  \ and personal situation, or if there is an alternative type of gift you would like\
  \ to leave to WWF.\nResiduary gift.\n\u2018I give XX% of my estate to WWF-UK of\
  \ The Living Planet Centre Rufford House Brewery Road Woking Surrey registered charity\
  \ number 1081247 for its charitable purposes and I further direct that the receipt\
  \ of the Honorary Treasurer or other proper officer of WWF-UK for the time being\
  \ shall be a full and sufficient discharge for the said legacy.\u2019.\nPecuniary\
  \ gift.\n\u2018I give XX to WWF-UK of The Living Planet Centre Rufford House Brewery\
  \ Road Woking Surrey registered charity number 1081247 for its charitable purposes\
  \ and I further direct that the receipt of the Honorary Treasurer or other proper\
  \ officer of WWF-UK for the time being shall be a full and sufficient discharge\
  \ for the said legacy.\u2019."
- Is there a minimum amount I need to be able to donate to include WWF in my Will?
- "No \u2013 Gifts in Wills come in all shapes and sizes and we\u2019re grateful for\
  \ all gifts received because so much of our work would not be possible without this\
  \ very special support."
- Can I leave a gift to a specific area of work?
- "We always do our utmost to honour any wishes about how a gift is used.\nThat said\
  \ stipulating conditions can make it more difficult for us to use wisely. Things\
  \ do change \u2013 some of our projects come to an end and new ones start; and sometimes\
  \ we may need to divert funds urgently and unrestricted gifts allow us to use funds\
  \ wherever they\u2019re needed most.\nWe\u2019d like to use your gift where it will\
  \ have the most impact, so we would suggest that you express a wish, rather than\
  \ a condition, that your gift be used to support a specific area of work."
- Why is it important to have a Will?
- "By having an up-to-date Will you can ensure that the people and causes that matter\
  \ to you most are looked after. A Will is the only way to guarantee that your wishes\
  \ are followed and your assets distributed to benefit those who matter most to you.\n\
  You can also use your Will to limit the amount of Inheritance Tax that needs to\
  \ be paid on your estate. If you don\u2019t have a Will your whole estate could\
  \ end up belonging to the Crown or the Government."
- How can I change my existing Will to include a gift to WWF?
- "You can update your existing Will with a Codicil form, but we do advise you speak\
  \ with your legal advisor about this to ensure that the Codicil is properly lodged\
  \ with your existing Will and doesn\u2019t invalidate your main Will."
- How can I make a donation in memory?
- 'We are really grateful to be a charity chosen when looking to remember someone
  special. Individual donations and group collections can be made directly on our
  donation site. Individuals can also contribute to a WWF Tribute Fund if this has
  been created for the person they are remembering.

  Alternatively, you can send in a cheque(s) with a cover letter or donation form
  to:.

  Supporter Care Team

  The Living Planet Centre

  Brewery Road

  Woking

  GU21 4LL.'

- We will send you a personal thank you letter and card for each in-memory donation
  received. Donations to Tribute Funds are thanked with an email message, but we are
  very happy to send a card or letter for these donations if preferred.
- What is a WWF Tribute Fund?
- "A WWF Tribute Fund is an opportunity for you to remember someone you loved and\
  \ collect donations and even fundraise for WWF in their memory. We\u2019ve created\
  \ a special place for you to do this online. You can find more about WWF Tribute\
  \ Funds here.\nTo talk this option through with Ella and Grace in our In-Memory\
  \ Team please contact us at inmemoryteam@wwf.org.uk or call 01483 412 153."
- Can I request resources for a collection?
- Yes, you can request resources by using our enquiry form or by calling 01483 412
  153. We have an in-memory giving information leaflet which also includes a donation
  form, envelopes to help you collect gifts in memory, and a collection box. You can
  also collect donations online by setting up a WWF Tribute Fund.
- Can I request for my donation to go to a particular area of your work?
- "In-memory gifts are used to support our work wherever the need is greatest. WWF\
  \ works across landscapes and policy areas to drive the change we desperately need\
  \ to protect our planet and create a future where people and nature thrive. If you\
  \ do have a specific wish for your donations to be used for a particular area of\
  \ work, please contact Ella and Grace in our In-Memory Giving team at inmemoryteam@wwf.org.uk\
  \ or 01483 412 153 who\u2019ll be able to discuss the best options."
- "I\u2019d like to set up an adoption or membership in memory, how can I do this?"
- "We are really touched that you\u2019d like to support us through an adoption or\
  \ membership in memory of someone loved. Please get in touch with Ella and Grace\
  \ at inmemoryteam@wwf.org.uk or 01483 412 153 who will be able to help you organise\
  \ this."
- Can I take part in events in memory?
- "You can set up an event or activity through your Tribute Fund. Maybe you would\
  \ like to host a bake sale, a garden party, or a walk of remembrance through their\
  \ favourite park. Each event you create will link back to your tribute fund, enabling\
  \ you to see the overall total raised in memory.\nWe are also able to offer places\
  \ in some of the UK\u2019s best-known challenge events such as the Brighton Marathon\
  \ and Ride London. Please contact the team at challenge@wwf.org.uk to register your\
  \ interest."
- "We are Funeral Directors and have collected donations \u2013 will you send the\
  \ acknowledgement to us or the Next of Kin?"
- We will send an acknowledgement to you as you have kindly organised the collection
  and a thank you letter and card to the next of Kin if you have their permission
  to share their contact details with us.
- How can I ensure that I don't receive telephone calls from WWF?
- "The telephone is one of the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective fundraising\
  \ tools for WWF UK and we're grateful to everyone who takes the time to speak to\
  \ us.\nOf course we appreciate it's not for everyone, so if you'd prefer not to\
  \ receive phone calls from us we completely understand. Therefore, if you\u2019\
  d like to change this, please call our Supporter Care team on 01483 426333 (8am\

- Why do WWF use the telephone to fundraise?
- 'The telephone is one of the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective fundraising
  methods for WWF-UK. We only call people if they are already a WWF supporter. We
  use the phone to thank our supporters and to ensure that their adoption or membership
  pack has arrived safely. We also use it to keep our supporters informed about our
  vital conservation work and how their support is making a difference. We also call
  supporters to ask them to renew their support and/or increase their monthly gift
  if they want to.

  We use a number of high quality telephone fundraising agencies to make calls on
  our behalf. All of the agencies we work with are closely monitored to ensure calling
  is of the highest standard and complies with fundraising regulation.

  If you don''t want to receive telephone calls from WWF, you can easily opt-out anytime
  by calling our Supporter Care team on 01483 426333 (8am - 7pm on Monday to Thursdays,
  8am - 5pm on Fridays and 10am - 4pm on Saturdays) or email supportercare@wwf.org.uk.'
- Why do WWF use the telephone to fundraise?
- 'Thank you so much for raising money for WWF, we really appreciate your support!.

  Please send your cheque, made payable to WWF-UK, to:.

  Supporter Services

  It would be great if you could also let us know how you raised the money as we love
  to hear about our supporters fundraising efforts. Please also remember to include
  your name and address so we can send a certificate and a letter of thanks.'
- Can I make a one-off donation to WWF?
- You can make a one-off donation to WWF using your credit or debit card on our secure
  server by visiting Donate page. Alternatively, you can call our Supporter Care team
  on 01483 426333 (8am - 7pm on Monday to Thursdays, 8am - 5pm on Fridays and 10am

- What is the Direct Debit Guarantee?
- 'Your Rights.

  Organisations using the Direct Debit Scheme go through a careful vetting process
  before they''re authorised, and are closely monitored by the banking industry. The
  efficiency and security of Direct Debit are monitored and protected by your own
  bank or building society.

  The Direct Debit Guarantee applies to all Direct Debits. It protects you in the
  rare event that there is an error in the payment of your Direct Debit, for instance,
  if a payment is taken on the incorrect date, or the wrong amount is collected.

  Direct Debit Guarantee.'
- What date will my Direct Debit be claimed?
- 'Thank you so much for setting up a Direct Debit with WWF, we''re really grateful
  for all your kind support.

  Our Direct Debits are claimed on two dates; on or around the 14th of the month or
  the last working day of the month.

  You''ll receive written confirmation of your Direct Debit details including the
  date your Direct Debit will be claimed at least ten working days in advance of your
  first Direct Debit payment.

  Under the Direct Debit Guarantee, we''ll always contact you at least ten working
  days in advance if we need to make any changes to the way we administer your Direct
  Debit.'
- Why do you prefer people to make regular gifts by Direct Debit?
- 'Regular gifts by Direct Debit mean charities have a consistent, predictable income,
  so we can plan and budget better and therefore be more efficient.

  They also give long-term security and enable short-term response to react to situations
  as soon as they arise; and the income to carry on with our work whether issues are
  receiving media coverage or not.

  Regular gifts also mean lower support costs and cheaper bank charges so that more
  of your money goes to our work.

  Ongoing support helps us recoup the higher costs of securing new donors. Securing
  new donors'' support is crucial to allow the charity to keep functioning. However,
  there''s a certain cost associated with reaching those donors. If people commit
  to giving regularly for a year or more, charities will recoup those costs.'
- I would like to change my Direct Debit to be taken from my account on a date of
  my choice. How do I do this?
- "We only offer two dates for your Direct Debit to be claimed: on or around the 14th\
  \ or the 26th of every month.  With Direct Debits claimed on or around the 26th\
  \ of the month, your donation will be debited from your bank account on the last\
  \ working day of the month.\nIf you\u2019d like to change the date your Direct Debit\
  \ is currently claimed,  please call our Supporter Care team on 01483 426333 (8am\
  \ - 7pm on Monday to Thursdays, 8am - 5pm on Fridays and 10am - 4pm on Saturdays)."
- I pay by Direct Debit and my bank account has changed. How do I update my account
  details with you?
- 'Usually, if you change your bank account details, your bank will provide a service
  where they notify all of your Direct Debit Service Users of your new account details
  so you don''t have to do anything.

  However, if you''ve chosen to advise all Service Users of your new details yourself,
  you can call our Supporter Care team on 01483 426333 (8am - 7pm on Monday to Thursdays,
  8am - 5pm on Fridays and 10am - 4pm on Saturdays) or download and complete a printable
  form.

  For data protection reasons, please don''t send your new bank account details to
  us via e-mail or web form.'
- Can I support you from overseas by Direct Debit?
- "Yes, it's possible to support us by Direct Debit if you're overseas but only if\
  \ you have a UK bank or building society account that accepts Direct Debits.\nIf\
  \ you don't have a UK bank or building society that accepts Direct Debit, you can\

- Why can't I set up a recurring card payment?
- The option for recurring card payments is being trialled and is only available via
  one of our face to face fundraisers.
- Why do WWF use fundraisers?
- "Fundraising in the high streets, house to house and in venues like shopping centres\
  \ is a cost effective way to generate more funds to inspire the public about our\
  \ work.\u202F This is vital if we're to maintain and grow our conservation programmes.\u202F\
  \ However, we're always monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our fundraising\
  \ and if they're no longer proving cost effective we'll either adapt or discontinue\
  \ the activity."
- How does WWF pay its fundraisers?
- "WWF-UK isn't able to employ a team of fundraisers ourselves, so we have contracts\
  \ in place with professional fundraising agencies who do the work for us.\u202F\
  This has proven to be successful and cost-effective.\nWWF-UK\u202Fpays the fundraising\
  \ agencies (who appoint the fundraisers) a fixed rate for every person who signs\
  \ up to become a WWF-UK\u202Fmember or adopts an animal.\u202FWWF-UK doesn't pay\
  \ the agency if people decline to sign up.\u202FDifferent agencies have different\
  \ wage structures to pay their fundraisers."
- Are the police and councils aware of WWF's fundraisers?
- "Yes, in some cases.\u202FWWF-UK holds national exemption certificates which mean\
  \ we can fundraise without approval from local authorities in England, Wales and\
  \ Northern Ireland.\u202FThere is no requirement for a certificate in Scotland.\u202F\
  However, we advise agencies to notify all local authorities and police stations\
  \ in advance of our arrival in an area anyway.\u202F For some forms of fundraising,\
  \ such as private sites like shopping centres, permission is given by the owners\
  \ of the venue and fundraisers will have documentation to this effect.\nOutside\
  \ of London, different arrangements are in place with local authorities to gain\
  \ permission and arrange mutually convenient access to their sites. We take seriously\
  \ any feedback from local councils - positive or negative - and require fundraising\
  \ agencies to forward any complaints they receive directly to us.\nIn some instances,\
  \ fundraisers also provide their names; badge IDs and dates they'll be in the area\
  \ to local police stations - though this is not a specific requirement."
- When I sign up via a fundraiser, do my donations go direct to WWF?
- "Yes, your donations go directly into WWF-UK's account.\u202FYour payments are completely\
  \ secure.\u202F The fundraising organisation that the fundraiser works for is not\
  \ involved in any financial transactions taken from your account."
- What time of day/night are fundraisers allowed to approach me?
- "Fundraisers are contracted to work on our behalf from 9am \u2013 9pm (Monday \u2013\
  \ Saturday) and 10am \u2013 9pm (Sunday). Please let us know if you have fundraisers\
  \ calling outside these times by calling our Supporter Care Team on 01483 426333\
  \ (Monday to Thursday - 8am to 7pm, Fridays - 8am to 5pm and Saturdays - 10am to\
  \ 4pm)."
- How do I know if a fundraiser is genuine?
- "Fundraisers will be wearing WWF-UK uniforms, which may be in the form of t-shirts,\
  \ polo shirts, sleeveless tabards or jackets. Fundraisers operate on busy streets,\
  \ in shopping centres and similar venues and house to house. The uniforms they wear\
  \ may differ slightly depending on where they're fundraising.\nFundraisers will\
  \ also carry an ID card which bears their name, photo and details of the fundraising\
  \ organisation they work for. If you're unsure about the legitimacy of a fundraiser,\
  \ ask to call the fundraising organisation they work for or contact WWF-UK's Supporter\
  \ Care Team on 01483 426333 (Monday to Thursday - 8am to 7pm, Fridays - 8am to 5pm\
  \ and Saturdays - 10am to 4pm) and press option 4.\nOur fundraisers will not ask\
  \ for money or be able to take cash donations from you.\u202FThey'll only ask you\
  \ to support via reoccurring card payment or direct debit. If a fundraiser asks\
  \ you for cash, please refuse and report the incident to us by calling 01483 426333\
  \ immediately as this will not be a genuine WWF-UK\u202Ffundraiser."
- Do WWF fundraisers operate in No Cold Calling Zones?
- "No, we don't.\u202FNo Cold Calling Zones (NCCZs) in the UK\u202Fare designated\
  \ zones to prevent people selling goods.\u202FThey're not designated zones to prevent\
  \ charities from fundraising.\u202FHowever, we do require our fundraisers to avoid\
  \ these areas in case residents regard fundraisers as salespeople.\nIn those areas\
  \ where NCCZs have not been formally set up but residents have placed a 'No Cold\
  \ Calling' sticker on their door, we also require fundraisers to avoid these homes.\u202F\
  \ Though they're directed not to call on doors displaying such stickers, it is possible\
  \ a fundraiser may have genuinely not seen the sticker; in which case please point\
  \ it out to them."
- How does WWF ensure that vulnerable people aren't targeted by fundraisers?
- "WWF-UK\u202Ffundraisers are trained not to ask people to become a member of WWF-UK\u202F\
  or to adopt an animal if they appear vulnerable.\nIf you or somebody you know has\
  \ felt uncomfortable with a WWF-UK\u202Ffundraiser, please let us know by calling\
  \ our Supporter Care Team on 01483 426333 (Monday to Thursday - 8am to 7pm, Fridays\
  \ - 8am to 5pm and Saturdays - 10am to 4pm)."
- Is the information that I give to a fundraiser secure?
- Yes, all the personal information you give to our fundraisers is secure and treated
  confidentially. Fundraisers will collect your information either using digital devices
  such as iPads or using a paper form, depending on whether they are operating in
  high streets, shopping centres or house to house. All fundraising agencies (who
  employ the fundraisers) are bound by data protection legislation and must not share
  your information with anyone else except WWF-UK. After your information has been
  securely transferred to WWF-UK the fundraising agencies destroy all your information
  once they have completed their responsibilities.
